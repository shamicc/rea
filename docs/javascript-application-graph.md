# JavaScript Application Graph

JavaScript Application Graph is REA's provider-neutral domain model for
connecting shipped application bytes, JavaScript structure, Electron process
boundaries, passive browser observations, and native add-ons. It is a durable,
canonical data contract; it is not an extractor or a new CLI/MCP tool.

The implementation is pure and side-effect free. It validates caller-supplied
facts, derives semantic identifiers, enforces graph integrity, and serializes
verified graphs as RFC 8785 canonical JSON. It performs no filesystem or CDP
I/O, does not evaluate JavaScript, and has no application-specific node kinds.

## Layer boundary

The graph complements existing REA models instead of replacing them:

| Existing model               | Responsibility                                                                         | Application Graph use                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Artifact graph               | Content-addressed containers, byte occurrences, and extraction boundaries              | Supplies artifact identities and exact paths               |
| Web bundle analysis          | Bounded AST, chunk, route, endpoint, and source-map observations                       | Supplies static nodes and relationships                    |
| Browser/Electron observation | Authorized passive CDP metadata and runtime captures                                   | Supplies runtime instances and `observed_as` relationships |
| Native analysis              | Provider-qualified binary functions, symbols, and references                           | Supplies native add-on/export observations                 |
| JavaScript Application Graph | Cross-layer entity identity, evidence-bearing relationships, and canonical commitments | Preserves the combined application model                   |

The shipped [JavaScript artifact reconstruction](javascript-artifact-reconstruction.md)
service projects bounded directory/ASAR, package, bundle, source-map,
BrowserWindow, preload, contextBridge, IPC, utility-process, and JavaScript-side
native binding facts into this graph. The separate
[static/runtime reconciliation](javascript-runtime-reconciliation.md) service
adds capture-scoped targets, frames, scripts, workers, and inferred
`observed_as` edges from already-produced Evidence. Native binary export
verification remains a separate later layer. The domain graph itself never
reaches outward to obtain any of those facts.

## Stored record

A stored graph has this top-level shape:

```text
schema: "JavaScriptApplicationGraph"
graph_id: jag_<sha256 of normalized graph semantics>
root_node_ids: jag_node_<sha256>[]
nodes: application entities with one or more observations
edges: directed evidence-bearing relationships
coverage: complete, partial, unknown, or unavailable
limitations: explicit graph-wide constraints
```

Parsing rejects unknown fields, non-canonical ordering, duplicate IDs, stale
semantic commitments, missing roots, dangling endpoints, self-edges, and
`changed_from` edges between unlike node kinds. Constructors normalize set-like
arrays before deriving their IDs.

## Entities and relationships

The node vocabulary covers:

- package, installer, and artifact;
- ASAR entry;
- Electron main, preload, renderer, and utility process code;
- JavaScript asset, chunk, and module;
- source map and original source module;
- BrowserWindow, frame, and target;
- contextBridge API, IPC channel, and IPC handler;
- worker and service worker;
- endpoint and storage;
- native add-on and native export;
- runtime script instance;
- an explicit `unknown` kind when classification is not justified.

The directed relation vocabulary is `contains`, `loads`, `imports`, `maps_to`,
`exposes`, `sends`, `invokes`, `handles`, `calls`, `persists_to`, `observed_as`,
and `changed_from`. Provider names are deliberately absent from both
vocabularies.

For example, a source-owned synthetic fixture proves this path without using a
third-party application:

```text
package contains app.asar
main asset contains BrowserWindow
BrowserWindow loads preload role
preload asset exposes contextBridge API
preload asset invokes uniquely matched main-process IPC handler
main-process IPC handler handles literal IPC channel
JavaScript asset imports requested native binding
resolved native add-on exposes requested binding (not a verified binary export)
```

The `loads`, `exposes`, `invokes`, `handles`, and `imports` relationships remain
static inferences. Dynamic or ambiguous IPC is retained without a pairing edge.
Runtime entities retain passive-CDP authority, while a successful static/runtime
correspondence is a separately identified cross-layer inference.

## Evidence and authority

Every observation and edge carries all of the following:

- an authority, such as artifact bytes, AST analysis, static relationship
  inference, passive CDP runtime, and cross-layer reconciliation,
  native analysis, historical reference, or user assertion;
- an epistemic state: `observed`, `inferred`, `unknown`, or `unavailable`;
- confidence independently bounded as exact, high, medium, low, or unknown;
- an explicit content-addressed artifact reference or an unavailable reason;
- an explicit artifact, source, URL, runtime, native, or package-export
  location, or an unavailable reason;
- extractor name, version, operation, and optional executable digest;
- coverage status, truncation, omitted count, and named limits;
- limitations and links to existing Evidence records;
- a content-derived identifier and its declared stability strategy.

Authority and epistemic state are separate fields. An AST observation does not
become a runtime fact, and a passive runtime fact does not prove which static
module produced it. In particular:

- `static-relationship-inference` can only produce `inferred` facts;
- `cross-layer-reconciliation` can only produce `inferred` facts and must link
  both static and runtime Evidence;
- unknown or unavailable facts require unknown confidence and a limitation;
- inferred facts require an explicit limitation;
- exact confidence is reserved for observations;
- all observations require an actionable location, and artifact-backed facts
  require a digest;
- static/native authorities cannot claim runtime locations;
- truncated coverage must be partial, name the limiting bound, and not claim
  zero omissions;
- complete coverage cannot be truncated or omit items.

Unavailable values are represented explicitly rather than as missing fields,
so absence of evidence cannot silently become evidence of absence.

## Entity identity

Nodes separate stable entity identity from individual observations. Changing a
label, extractor, or evidence record changes the observation ID without
necessarily changing the node ID.

| Strategy                  | Stability scope                  | Intended use                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content-digest`          | Globally exact bytes             | Artifacts and byte-identical assets                               |
| `source-map-original`     | One source-map commitment        | Recovered original source modules                                 |
| `canonical-path`          | One artifact version             | ASAR entries and assets at exact normalized paths                 |
| `artifact-local-key`      | One artifact version             | IPC channels, handlers, exports, and other named entities         |
| `structural-fingerprint`  | Explicit cross-version inference | Modules whose relationship is hypothesized from bounded structure |
| `runtime-instance`        | One capture only                 | Targets, frames, runtime scripts, and workers                     |
| `observation-fingerprint` | One observation scope            | Facts with no stronger justified identity                         |

Every strategy states its stability scope. Runtime identities commit the
capture digest and runtime key; canonical-path and artifact-local identities
commit the containing artifact digest. Structural fingerprints require an
inferred supporting observation and never claim exact cross-version identity.
Content-digest and source-map identities require an observation of the same
artifact digest.

Observation IDs use `semantic-content-sha256` with `observation-exact`
stability. Edge IDs use the same derivation with `relationship-exact`
stability. Node, observation, edge, and graph IDs are recomputed during parsing,
so callers cannot preserve a stale ID after changing semantic content.

## Structure

The graph does not impose aggregate caps on roots, nodes, edges, observations,
or JSON properties. Properties must be valid JSON; field-specific validation
still applies to paths, identifiers, and evidence values. Extractors report
actual omissions in coverage instead of silently dropping a prefix.

## Domain API

The public domain functions are:

- `createJavaScriptApplicationNode` to normalize an entity and derive node and
  observation IDs;
- `createJavaScriptApplicationEdge` to normalize a relationship and derive its
  ID;
- `createJavaScriptApplicationGraph` to sort complete graph content and derive
  its graph ID;
- `parseJavaScriptApplicationGraph` to verify a stored graph and every
  commitment;
- `serializeJavaScriptApplicationGraph` for canonical JSON;
- `computeJavaScriptApplicationGraphSha256` for a byte-stable verified graph
  digest.
