## Start with one command

```bash
npx rea-agents setup
```

Choose your agent, review the planned changes, and approve setup. Native binary
analysis can use an existing Hopper, Ghidra, or IDA installation; static
JavaScript analysis needs no native analysis engine.

For a first result from an extracted JavaScript application or ASAR:

```bash
npx -y rea-agents@latest analyze-javascript-application /absolute/path/to/app --json
```

See [installation and setup](./installation.md) for requirements and configuration.
