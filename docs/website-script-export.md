# Captured website scripts and static JavaScript analysis

`export_web_scripts` bridges retained browser sources into the existing local
JavaScript analyzer. Both CLI and MCP use the same workflow. It reads a saved
`inspect_web_page` or `capture_browser_scenario` capture and writes scripts plus a
verified manifest into one caller-selected, absent directory.

## Capture and export

For passive inspection, select `include_script_sources: true` (CLI:
`--include-script-sources`). For scenarios, select
`capture.network.response_body: true`. Save either the complete Evidence record
or its normalized result as UTF-8 JSON. The compact MCP wrapper's `evidence`
field contains the complete Evidence record.

```sh
rea export-web-scripts /analysis/capture.json /analysis/exported-scripts --json
rea analyze-javascript-application /analysis/exported-scripts/files --json
```

MCP uses `export_web_scripts` with `capture_path` and `output_directory` absolute
filesystem paths. Its inline result includes `analysis_input`, which can be
passed directly to `analyze_javascript_application`. When no script bytes are
exportable, `analysis_input` is null and the manifest retains the unavailable
sources and their reasons. Capture again with the corresponding content option.

The destination must not exist. Use a new directory for each capture; an
existing directory or symlink is rejected without overwriting its contents.
REA creates private output, verifies every written file by digest and durable
readback, and removes its own partial output on failure or cancellation.
A failed rollback reports residual paths.

## Sources and mappings

Every source is returned inline with its URL and its script/frame identity or
request transaction and event sequence references. The result also contains
the input capture's byte digest, original coverage, source Evidence link when
provided, and the persisted manifest's digest and byte count. A saved Evidence
envelope must have a valid semantic identifier and matching operation.

Exported `relative_path` values are relative to `analysis_input.input_path`.
The persisted `manifest.json` contains the same inline manifest fields, excluding
its own descriptor. It does not duplicate script bytes.

- Passive sources are the Debugger-exposed text encoded as UTF-8, with the
  verified source digest and source-map declaration retained. Unavailable or
  explicitly non-JavaScript sources remain unavailable.
- Scenario sources use observed requests classified as `script`, matched to
  completed response bytes by transaction and event identity. URLs never select
  the response. Binary and empty retained bytes are written exactly.
- Ordinary query-free `.js`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs` URL paths are arranged under a
  directory for each origin, preserving their relative module layout when it
  is unambiguous.
- Competing versions, query/fragment variants, case and file/directory prefix
  collisions, inline sources, and unrepresentable paths use unique isolated
  names with a stated reason. Missing competing sources also prevent selection
  of an apparently canonical version.

## Interpretation and limits

Export does not fetch URLs or execute JavaScript. Retained Debugger sources and
response bytes do not establish execution or a complete website. Response bytes
are browser-decoded bytes; they do not represent transfer encoding. Declared
redaction is preserved and can change JavaScript syntax; passive captures do
not report a byte-redaction flag, so that value remains unknown.

The existing analyzer inventories and parses the actual exported files. It can
resolve ordinary captured relative modules, but does not implement browser
import maps, root-relative URL loading, remote imports, or runtime behavior.
Its local resolver may strip import queries/fragments; isolated variants are
kept away from canonical paths to prevent those from selecting a different
observed version. Missing dependencies remain unknown. Source maps are not
fetched or reconstructed during export.

The export Evidence describes a derivation from the saved capture. Subsequent
application-analysis Evidence describes the local exported artifact. Their
identities and authorities remain separate.

## Verification

`npm run verify:browser:scripts` exercises active capture, exact source export,
manifest readback, query variants, and relative-module analysis through a real
browser, CLI, and stdio MCP. Set `REA_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to an installed
Chrome-family browser. The verifier accepts an optional installed REA entrypoint
argument for package verification. `npm run verify:browser` additionally covers
passive `inspect_web_page` export through both public adapters.
