/**
 * Pure string predicates for artifact path syntax. The local artifact
 * resolver, the Electron native specifier check, and (by reference) the
 * live-DOM and source-map URL handling share these character-level rules.
 *
 * Policy divergence (deliberate, not yet unified):
 * - Local artifact paths resolve against an inventoried container root and
 *   report rejected | external | not-found. Confinement is lexical
 *   (posix.normalize must stay inside the root).
 * - Live DOM destinations resolve against the document base URL and report
 *   approved | outside_policy | unsupported against allowedOrigins
 *   (see CdpCaptureDocuments.domDestination).
 * - Source-map fetches require exact-origin http(s) without credentials
 *   (see WebSourceMapFetcher.approvedUrl).
 * Unifying those outcome vocabularies is a separate, observable change.
